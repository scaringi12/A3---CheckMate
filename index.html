									<h2>Patrick Leonello</h2>
									<p>Patrick is 21 years old and was born in Australia. He is of Italian descent, and English is his primary language. Still, he can pick up some Italian from being around his Nonna (grandma), teaching her to use modern-day technology.
									Patrick graduated VCE from Loyola College Watsonia in 2017, then completed a certificate four and a diploma in screen and media, live production and Technical services in 2018-2019. Patrick enjoys creating and editing videos specifically; he enjoys the technical element of fluently putting together a coherent story that conveys emotion and a story from just raw footage. He has worked with Floorworld and AFLW star Monique Conti creating corporate style videos. Patrick has always been interested in pursuing Information Technology. Patrick is Interested in UCD (user-centred design). Developing applications and websites and combining different design elements and principles such as contrast, colour, typefaces can affect how the user interacts and feels and how that can influence their experience in positive and negative ways. In high school, Patrick always chose the I.T. and Computing subjects, where he learnt the basics of database management, web design, infographics, and a little bit of game development. Other than that, the first few weeks of the bachelor of information technology has been the bulk of Patrick I.T. experience learning the basics of programming using Python, management and development of databases, and user-centred design and web development using HTML.

Joshua's major was Chinese, and during the degree, he studied in Shanghai, China, for six months. After Joshua returned, he changed his degree to a business/international studies double degree. Still, he ultimately found that he didn't enjoy it and couldn't find many job opportunities. Joshua Has worked 28 different jobs since the age of 15, the most current and longest one being a bartender role. Joshua's Internet in IT began when he was younger; thanks to his favourite Properties such as Disney's Tron and the Digimon series, both had highly fantasized elements of tech. He enjoyed studying IT in secondary school but never continued because of advice from a careers adviser. His love for video games and attempting to learn the development of games helped direct him back to university to study IT. Recently Joshua has begun working on coding, app making, website-making, game making etc. He has always wanted to make video games and found more enjoyment with the code side than the actual game design part.

									<h1>Group processes</h1>
									<p>Overall, our group worked well together as we communicated efficiently and effectively. In Assignment 2 we had frequent group calls every week varying between 1-2. We discussed progression of tasks and helped each other if some tasks were taking longer than usual to complete. I believe that our communication skills were quite high tier as there was constant communication on different types of media, we used messenger groups and teams mainly to interact and share thoughts. We worked very well as a team, getting work done and not getting distracted in meetings. We shared work throughout the group and contribution was shared out as evenly as we could.
									<br>
								  </br>
									We all gelled very well together pretty much from the start with everyone talking in meetings and in the messenger group sharing ideas and thoughts. Each member was very supportive of other members if there were any times where something came up and the member could not attend a meeting or anything like that. Each individual team member gave updates on what they were up to in the work and estimates on completion times which made the timeline of work easily trackable.
								  </p>
									<br>
								</br>
								<h1>Any changes for A3?</h1>
								<p>For this assignment, we have emphasised the importance of teamwork and organization as we’ve increased the number of meetings from 2 a week to 3 a week and have stressed the importance of constant communication more in this assignment. We have implemented a new meeting structure using a powerpoint that displays topics that are needed to be discussed in the meetings. We also have a more effective way to track progression of tasks with a powerpoint slide that shows the deadlines for sections of the project and who will complete it.
								<br></br>
								During the creation of our GitHub repo in Assignment 2 we struggled to realise that it takes a lot of time to create a site so for this assignment we have started creating it early on in the project rather than keeping it as a last minute section of the project. We also have dispersed the workload of tasks among workers in a more effective way as there are some tasks that have all of our team members working on. During the last assignment we had one person working on github but for this assignment we are having more people working on it so it's easier to complete and less stressing on one particular person.</p>

						<h1>Project</h1>

							<h2><u>Overview</u></h2>
									<p>This project is intended to create a to-do list application that can be used for the user to create their to-do lists in a simple and easy way just with simply pressing buttons. The app can be used to notify and set dates and times for the tasks to be completed keeping the user organised and on track with their tasks. The app will assist with responsibilities and organisation skills in the user’s day to day life. The modern design and layout scheme of the design is easily navigated and good to look at providing an easy going and aesthetically pleasing experience.

										The social sharing and group work aspect of the app is intended to make it easier for users in today’s world to work on tasks together and keep track of each member’s progress through the work and setting deadlines for said work. In a world with a constant and substantial growth in the need for virtual group work and sharing due to the growth in the IT industry and a global pandemic forcing people to isolate and avoid contact having said social sharing feature is an amazing feature to have in a to-do list type application, along with the simplicity of the sharing it will have an exceptional outcome for the popularity and usability of the application.
										</p>
							<br>

							<h2><u>Motivation</u></h2>
									<p>This project is an important application for not just the IT industry but most people in the world, the ability to track and create one’s to-do list is very important as it will allow for the users to have and simply and creative way to create their lists. It is also a good way for the user to remember the things they must do along with keeping track of the status of the tasks to be completed as the app allows status updates, deletion of tasks and deadline features that can keep the user in line. The social interactive feature is a very important feature for the current IT trends of today, with the constantly growing industry along with the current global pandemic group work and especially virtual group work is extremely crucial for all users. Having a virtual to-do list that can be shared through social media can make it much easier to keep track of things like group work in work, school etc. and even day to day things like grocery lists. A future employer could see the working and creation of the project as very creative and innovative thinking from all the group members. </p>
							<br>

							<h2><u>Landscape</u></h2>
									<p>
										The closest comparable “to-do list” application widely available would be the Reminders application that comes with iPhones, or similar apps like Google Calendar. These applications host internal lists for the user and store them in the app, which in some instances (Google Calendar) can be accessed on the computer as well. These apps are mainly solo, and may not offer the ability to share to-do lists.

										Social media-wise, the main competitors would be well-known giants Facebook, who, with Instagram, Facebook and the many other platforms they own, dominate the social media market (Rodriguez, 2021). These giants introduced and refined the common social media messaging systems we use today and offer specific messaging services. These apps are great for their specific markets but don’t offer the to-do list and sharing capabilities Checkmate is offering.


										In terms of group to-do lists, Asana and Stack are common business-driven applications that host similar features. These are used by companies for communication and performance assessment, so don’t really offer a social media aspect, which discourages use outside of work hours.

										What these apps don’t possess, which is being offered with the Checkmate app, is the combination of social media, personal to-do lists, group to-do lists, and the ability to suggest to others their own “to-do” lists.
										</p>


	<h2><u>Aims</u></h2>


	The project's main aim is to build and design as much of a complete application as possible in the time limit with our minimal expertise. Firstly we decided to learn as much as possible about both the programming and design elements of building an application from scratch. We split our group into two subgroups, with one dedicated to learning programming using Koltin with Android studio and the other group learning the ins and outs of the design progress using Figma as a design tool. This way, both groups can gain knowledge and come out with two or more actual artifacts as evidence of our journey.

	Firstly we decided to create a desired feature list to aid and inspire both groups to design and code. This is that feature list
	<table style="width:100%">
		<tr>
		  <th>Feature</th>
		  <th>Description</th>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Inputting tasks</td>
		  <td>The user taps on a text box to type in a description of the task, there will be a submit button and the user will be given a warning asking if they really want to input this task as the app ‘will ensure you complete this task’.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		  <td>Mandatory word count for explanation</td>
		  <td>If the user needs defer or completely delete the task, they must write an explanation on why they are deleting the task, the app checks the character count of the inputted text, if it is less than a specific amount an error will appear, saying ‘not good enough, you should still get this done!’
	</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Count of completed tasks</td>
			<td>The app will also count the number of tasks completed which will allow the user to evaluate their productivity for the day.</td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Task quota</td>
			<td>Users can set a quota, so that the app enforces before using the user must put in a minimum number of tasks, this is to incentivise productivity and assist with the solution to the problem the app is intended to solve.
	</td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Warnings and notifications</td>
			<td>Users will receive alerts towards the end of the day to remind users of outstanding tasks.</td>

		  </tr>
		<tr>
		  <td colspan="2"><b> Social list features </b> </td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Start new Group to-do list </td>
			<td>The user taps on “new social list” button and has the option to invite friend via a search bar </td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Inputting media suggestion tasks </td>
			<td>The user taps on “new media” and chooses from one of the following categories; film,TV,music, book, other. From here they can use a search bar that will add a preview of the desired media using its respective website eg imdb or Spotify </td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Mark suggestion as completed</td>
			<td>The user will have the option to mark as completed when tapping on the task. This will add a small  coloured tick next to the task</td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Rate a group task </td>
			<td>Once a user has marked a task as complete they will have the option to rate out of 5 stars by tapping on a line of stars</td>

		  </tr>
		  <tr>
			<td>Update personal/chat colours </td>
			<td>In the profile settings a user can select a unique colour that is used to identify which user has completed a task in a social list </td>

		  </tr>
	  </table>


	<h4>Design Aims</h4>
	<p>
	The UX/UI team had many goals. Firstly we had to find a design tool that was accessible and intuitive. We landed on Figma.com as we had used it before and already had a basic understanding on it’s layout and tools. We began with a template on figma as a basis but then decided to only use it for its assets as we stripped the template to its most basic layout. We then had to start designing our own application and we achieved this through the creation of Wireframes that we could later build upon to create a  higher fidelity design mock-up
	</p>

	<h4>Programing Aims</h4>
	<p>
	Furthermore, an important objective is formulating ideas for and producing functions for the app. We will get a good understanding of the fundamentals of the programming language Kotlin, so we can use Android Studio to begin experimenting for creating functions that will be included in the app, it is essential also that consistent labeling will be in the code for a potential professional programmer to pick up the task from us to further develop the app into a valuable product. This goal gives a platform to base further development off, such as adding more features and functions into the long-term future, it is imperative that Checkmate is future proof and easily upgradable as this will improve the chances of investors funding the development of this project beyond this founding stage.
	</p>

	<h4>Website Aim</h4>
	<p>
	The website was designed and made to alleviate a problem the app being made on android caused - accessibility. By starting a website, you give users access to the Checkmate app through multiple different venues - phones, computers, consoles, fridges. This allows future users of the Checkmate app to explore different uses of the app, and allows people multiple avenues of exposure to the site.
	</p>

	<h2><u>Plans and Progress</u></h2>
	<p>
	We started by deciding what tool we would be using to design the overall layout of Checkmate. After doing research, we narrowed it down to these few services.
	<ul>
	<li>Zeplin</li>
	<li>InVision</li>
	<li>Figma </li>
	<li>Adobe Photoshop </li>
	</ul>

	All had their Benefits, but we decided to go with Figma.com mainly because it is very accessible to the whole team as it is web-based, meaning no matter what device the team uses, they can all access it without downloading a whole program or Updates. Figma can generate a view-only link shared with other group members or as an asset to survey and gather feedback on its usability and design.
	Our next milestone was to find a basic template, strip it to its bare assets and build it from the ground up into something of our own. This began with wireframes. The wireframes are a fundamental outline of what our application might look like; it includes low fidelity details and is a skeleton of what we hope to achieve.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Wireframes</b></h4>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/wireframes1.png" alt="Wireframes1" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>
	<br></br>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/wireframes2.png" alt="Wireframes2" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>

	<p>
	Once our wireframes were completed and the group was satisfied with the layout we got to the main design. Here is a breakdown of the current Checkmate application UI/UX design
	</p>

	<h4><b>Checkmate Figma Concept</b></h4>
  <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/figma1.png" alt="Figma1" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>
	<br></br>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/figma2.png" alt="Figma2" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>
	<br></br>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/figma3.png" alt="Figma3" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>
	<br></br>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/figma4.png" alt="Figma4" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>
	<br></br>
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/figma5.png" alt="Figma5" style='max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%'/></a>

	<p>
	When designing the current version of the Checkmate application, we took into account Nielsen's Principles of design, such as User control and Freedom. We allow users to exit, redo, and notify them of the consequences of deleting something that satisfies the error prevention design principle we implemented. We attempted to have a consistent minimalistic and dream-like theme so we do not overcomplicate or confuse users. Our dream dark neon dream-like theme is aesthetically pleasing to the eye thanks to the mix of contrasting and complementing Vibrant colours, blurs and glow effects and designed to keep our message that all dreams start with small goals hence a need for the To-do list. The obvious Design Principle, such as Prominence, was implemented using bold tiles and larger text to guide the user's eyes around the application as we desire. Another design principle we have implemented is proximity, as we have similar tasks close to each other helping ease use for the user.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Programming Plans and Progress</b></h4>
	<p>

	Initially when we started the programming aspect of the project we intended to closely follow what we wrote in the A2 assignment and develop the application through adobe phonegap. However we were all greeted with this image and decided this endeavour would not be fruitful.
	<br></br>


	We next had a team meeting and decided the best way to develop the app would be through Android Studio and the tutorials provided by <a href= "https://www.raywenderlich.com/android/paths/learn"> Raywenderlich </a>. Since we had no prior programming experience in mobile app development and in using Kotlin programming language, we wanted to achieve making a simple task management app without worrying too much about the figma design of our app. We wanted to develop and build on our programming skills through the tutorials provided to be able to in future build the app through our figma designs. Basically our thought process behind this decision was Rome was not built in a day and neither was CheckMate.
	</p>

	<h4><b>TimeFighter</b></h4>
	<p>

	Timefighter was the introductory programming exercise provided by Raywenderlich with the purpose of teaching us the basics of Android Studio. i.e how to manipulate strings in the kotlin programming language, create working buttons and introduce us to android specific functions to make app development easier. The key takeaways from this mini project to begin development on CheckMate were to:
	<ul>
	<li>Create id’s and constraints for each element</li>
	<li>Handle orientation changes (everytime there is an orientation change the app resets without the proper code)</li>
	<li>Convert to an APK and upload to the Android play store. </li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h4><b>Checkmate</b></h4>
	<p>

	In the first week of programming the values that you see are hardcoded into the app in an array. Basically we made a recycler view the length of the screen and could add as many values as we liked. Obviously this has no real world practicality and the “hello first fragment” and next button were the wonderful part of programming of the i have no idea how or why they were there feature.

	The next week of programming we had developed a better understanding of the tools we were using and progressed further in the tutorials. We learned how to save data using shared preferences, add a second recycler view for the subtasks and allowed the user to implement their own tasks and subtasks. Achieving the minimum functionality requirement we set with the start of the project.


	When the user submits a task they’re taken to the subtask screen where they can tap the floating action Button in the bottom right of screen to add the subtasks they need to complete their goal.





	Finally when the user presses the back button or exits the app they are taken back to the first screen and can now tap on the task to be taken back to the subtask section of the app.

	</p>

	<h4><b>Future Programming Developments</b></h4>
	<p>

	Notably the programming side of development is very minimal compared to the figma designs and wireframes which is to be expected. Learning the tools and programming to the specifications takes time. Another key challenge was the programming tutorials were a little out of date Android studio is still being developed at a rapid pace and some now common place functionality components such as fragments: (fragments allow the app to work on multiple devices such as tablets and laptops without the need to change code) were hard to follow and code in the tutorial outright did not work because of further updates to android studio.


	</p>

	<h4><b>Fragments</b></h4>
	<p>

	We have emphasized the importance of fragments as these will expand the users that the app reaches. We will make use of fragments to enhance the code’s interactions with the user interface components. The fragments will help with transferring the project to professional software developers. The use of fragments will highlight the necessity of Checkmate being available across as wide a user base as possible.

	</p>

	<h4><b>Android Jetpack Navigation</b></h4>
	<p>
	The potential developers would want to have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of Android Studio. It will be essential to convey a rudimentary understanding of the WorkManager which is a vast library of jobs that must be completed within the programming aspect of the project. This Automated Programming Interface will be integral s to the development of Checkmate.


	</p>

	<h4><b>Animations</b></h4>
	<p>
	We will be making use of Androids animations to improve the usability of Checkmate in terms of user satisfaction. Primarily property animations will be favoured due to them being the most powerful and flexible of all Android animation frameworks.



	</p>

	<h4><b>Website</b></h4>
	<p>
	The website was designed as a side project to the programming to expand on the accessibility of the application and its users. By referencing a template created by w3schools, the website was made in a barebones, skeleton design to give initial users and idea of what the frontpage of the website would look like and what features would be available.
	Takeaways from this project were:
	<ul>
	<li>Design a website to build alongside the app</li>
	<li>Make functioning webpages consistent with the figma wireframes and Checkmate programming</li>
	<li>To pitch this to investors, more consistency between the app is needed</li>
	<li>Accessibility goes a long way</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Project Progress Timeline:</h4>

<p>

	Another difficult aspect of project planning is knowing how much time to allow.
 You will have something like
	36 hours per person for this assignment.
	In order to develop a plan for further work beyond the end of this
	course, let us assume that you will have an extra 10 hours per week per person for 10 weeks in addition to
	this time in order to develop your project. This means that you will have six weeks(Weeks 7 to 12) of the
	semester to work on your assignment, with a further 10 weeks after that. This means that your plan will be
	for a total of 15weeks, with the first 6 being on this assignment. You will clearly not have the extra 10
	weeks to work on the project; this is intended to give you a feeling for how much you would be able to
	achieve in that time. This means that the first 6 weeks of your timeline will end
	up being your actual progress on this project, with the remaining 10 weeks being your plan for the next
	stages. This should be presented in the form of a table, with one row for each week, specifying as best you
	can the work for each person for each week. This means that the first six rows of the table will describe
	your progress so far, and the remaining 10 your best guess at how the remaining time would work.

	This will no doubt change as you work on your assignment, as it will give you a more
	precise idea about how long it will take to get things done. This is not an unchangeable contract for
	exactly how things will work; that is unrealistic for just about any project. The idea is to get you
	thinking about how exactly your time should be allocated to the various tasks involved. It is a good idea to have a milestone (i.e. a specific outcome) for each week of the project
	. This may include getting familiar with tools, or reading up on a particular technique or
	technology. You should also include time for writing up the final report and any other documentation.
	Writing reports always takes longer than you think, especially as you should expect to
	re-write any piece of writing that you do at least three or four times.</p>
